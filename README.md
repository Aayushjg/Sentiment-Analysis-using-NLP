**Task 4 of the internship, I focused on performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective of this task was to extract meaningful insights from unstructured textual data, such as reviews or comments, by classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This type of analysis is widely used in fields like customer feedback monitoring, brand reputation management, and social media analytics. To complete this task, I selected a dataset composed of product reviews, where each review contained a sentence or paragraph of customer feedback and, optionally, a labeled sentiment score. The primary goal was to preprocess the text, apply a sentiment classification model, and evaluate the results for accuracy and interpretability.
The first step in the process was data preprocessing, which is crucial in NLP projects. I performed standard text-cleaning procedures such as converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, stop words (like "and", "the", "is"), and special characters. Additionally, I applied tokenization to split each review into individual words and lemmatization to convert those words to their base forms. These steps helped normalize the text and reduce noise, enabling the model to focus on the core meaning of the content.After preprocessing, I converted the cleaned text data into a numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency), which transforms words into weighted vectors based on how relevant they are to each review. This representation allows machine learning algorithms to process text as structured input. For the sentiment classification, I initially used a pre-trained rule-based approach called VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), which is particularly effective for short, social media-style texts. VADER analyzes the polarity of a sentence and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral based on a compound sentiment score.In addition to VADER, I also implemented a machine learning-based model using Logistic Regression. The labeled dataset was split into training and testing sets, and I trained the model on the TF-IDF vectors to classify review sentiment. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which gave insights into how well the model generalized to unseen data. The results were then visualized using confusion matrices and bar plots to compare predicted vs actual sentiments.Through this task, I gained valuable hands-on experience in natural language processing, especially in the context of sentiment analysis. I learned how to clean and prepare text data, convert it into numerical features, apply classification models, and evaluate their performance. This task also enhanced my understanding of how different types of models—both rule-based and machine learning-based—can be applied to interpret human language and extract sentiments from it.**
